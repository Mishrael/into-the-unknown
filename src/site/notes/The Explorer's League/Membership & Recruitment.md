## Initiation

To gain membership to the esteemed Explorer's League, one must first either find, or be found by a sponsor, willing to take them under their wing. As an Initiate, you are for all intents and purposes an unpaid intern at the beck-and-call of the sponsor. However, the sponsor has the responsibility to train their initiate up to be a skilled and bold adventurer for the League. To this end, they will generally spend countless hours teaching or training their Initiates, and the Initiate accompanies the sponsor on all expeditions, serving in more of a porter capacity, but that's more or less to keep the initiate safe -- if possible.

An Initiate's training culminates in an unchaperoned mission -- typically with other initiates -- on an expedition of the sponsor's choosing -- many sponsors collaborate to provide their initiates with the best possible chance for success. If the initiates survive their own expedition, returning to Anbaerin having completed the task set before them, they graduate -- Initiates are evaluated by League Master Fraevlas herself.

If the initiate fails in accomplishing their task and acquitting themselves in their role to the team, the sponsorship is evaluated, by a group of the sponsor's peers. If the instruction has been found lacking the Initiate is given a second chance, and usually a different sponsor -- though sponsorship is always voluntary, so there exists the potential that an Initiate will not have a sponsor ready to take them. In this event, they are put on what is basically a wait list. If the Initiate is found lacking, then they are summarily expelled from the League.

## Membership

With initiation complete, the Initiate becomes a member of the League, and that comes with a fair number of fringe benefits. For one, those that like the League are likely to view a member favorably. While the League operates more on voluntary work, there is usually a bunk you can fall into, and meals that are provided for all members that wish to partake -- the League is well funded after all and likes to take care of its members.

Members typically fall into the categories of captains, navigators/guides, men-at-arms, or scholars, but there are no membership titles -- aside from the name one would make for oneself! This is in part to prevent pigeon-holing a member into a specific role, where they may better serve as more of a generalist. Captaining an expedition here, and then providing expertise on the subject matter of an expedition there. Every expedition does has the four key roles of captain, man-at-arms, navigator, and scholar, however, it's best not to conflate expedition roles with membership titles.

## Leadership

As far as leadership and administrative duties go within the League, there are several. There are far too many parts of the organization for one person to monitor them as was done in the past with Archibald. There are too many things to keep one's eye on for even four people to keep track of. So there are Masters of the League. The Explorer's League Master is Iatharien Fraevlas, she's the president of the organization, and has veto power. There is a Master of Initiates, Master of Relations, Master of Research, Master of Collections, Master of Codes, and the Quartermaster. There is no Master of members because that is the League Master, herself.
