## The Ceremony of Four:
The League likes to send off new exploration ventures by reminding the crew of where they came from. Each Explorer's team has four pivotal roles: The captain, the man-at-arms, the navigator, and the scholar. The captain provides the vision and scope of the venture, and is given a spyglass to symbolize the role. The man-at-arms protects the crew and ensures their safety and is given a sword (traditionally a saber) to symbolize the role. The navigator keeps the venture on track and marks the way back and is given a compass to symbolize their role. The scholar records and studies the things uncovered and is given a quill to symbolize their role.

## Toast of Those Before:
Another embarkment tradition where the crew raise their drinks in honor of the bold and brave explorers before them.

## Initiation:
To gain membership to the esteemed Explorer's League, one must first either find, or be found by a sponsor, willing to take them under their wing. As an Initiate, you are for all intents and purposes an unpaid intern at the beck-and-call of the sponsor. However, the sponsor has the responsibility to train their initiate up to be a skilled and bold adventurer for the League. To this end, they will generally spend countless hours teaching or training their Initiates, and the Initiate accompanies the sponsor on all expeditions, serving in more of a porter capacity, but that's more or less to keep the initiate safe -- if possible.

An Initiate's training culminates in an unchaperoned mission -- typically with other initiates -- on an expedition of the sponsor's choosing -- many sponsors collaborate to provide their initiates with the best possible chance for success. If the initiates survive their own expedition, returning to Anbaerin having completed the task set before them, they graduate -- Initiates are evaluated by League Master Fraevlas herself.

If the initiate fails in accomplishing their task and acquiting themselves in their role to the team, the sponsorship is evaluated, by a group of the sponsor's peers. If the instruction has been found lacking the Initiate is given a second chance, and usually a different sponsor -- though sponsorship is always voluntary, so there exists the potential that an Initiate will not have a sponsor ready to take them. In this event, they are put on what is basically a wait list. If the Initiate is found lacking, then they are summarily expelled from the League.

## A Feast to Remember:
Upon returning home to Anbaerin, the crew of an expedition gather together for both debriefing and to tell the tales of the exploits and lives of their fallen comrades.

## Campfire Stories:
A bit tropey, and anyone whose been camping or shared a fire with someone would be familiar with this tradition, but because stories are so much of what being a part of the League is about, it makes sense that they would share their stories around a fire, as both a bonding exercise and a tradition.
