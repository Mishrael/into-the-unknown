## The Fauna and Flora Explosion:

While a myriad of creatures were re-discovered after the demons were cast back into their abyss, there seemed to be a plateau, once researchers had their hands full. But that was no limiter for the Explorer's League, who plunged deeper into the chaotic lands of Rukmär, pushed further into the jungles of Un'Kar, the Barrier Islands, and Northern Orenta, They've pushed up into the mountains, and over deserts. Finding many, many more species, and making even more work for already busy scholars of the natural world.

## The Discovery of Aerith:

Some of the more courageous, or foolish, members of the League decided to take an expedition into the north icy waters off the western coast of Naerous. They managed to find an uncharted land mass in the icy wastes, and took rudimentary charts of the island. If the cartographer was correct then, it was the third largest island in the world! A secondary expedition was launched to survey inland of the island, but they did not return. A third expedition was sent to find the survey team, but they were never heard from again either. Exploration of Aerith was given up, and many consider it cursed, due to its proximity to Naerous.

## Grave of the Gods:

Lord Bristol Gerrishman, et al., took an expedition to the remains of Mt. Ashar, said to be the seat of the gods before The Calamity destroyed it and brought his demonic hordes upon the world. Many believe the site to either be holy or cursed -- or both -- and no scholar had before been able to put together a team brave enough to venture into the Heart of the Calamity. Records of the venture say the land where the mountain once stood are harassed by keening winds, geothermal storms, magnetic storms, blizzards, and torrential rains. On the surface, not a pleasant place to be. But though delving into the depths provides shelter from the fierce elements, it is a realm of darkness, seemingly utterly devoid of light, that even sapped the warmth of a good fire. And the whispers. The incessant whispers! They were maddening! Lord Gerrishman, et al., spent several years in intense behavioral and pschyo therapy, and several of his crew did not survive the venture, even with our latest therapeutic methods.

Several other expeditions have made the journey, but the maddening whispers have repelled every attempt, that could survive past the storms, to delve to any significant depth. 

## The Expedition to the Heart of Rukmär:

Purportedly, founding member Archibald Fairfax was the first to make it to the Heart, and possibly the only since. Plenty of exploration accounts, League or otherwise, have claimed to make it to the Heart of Rukmär, known as the Rock of Rage, Mt. Anger, and -- more recently -- Sintegua as a native translation. While Fairfax has charts to the mountain, and the record of the venture is fraught with perils similar to those of other expeditions into Rukmär, several teams have followed Fairfax's charts to the letter, so they swear, and none have found their way to Sintegua -- indeed some never returned at all.

Of late, however, Captain Melina Perrington has been pushing hard into the wilds of Rukmär, attempting to be the second, if not the official first person to make it to Sintegua. Her progress has been middling at best, but she is now the League member to have survived the most expeditions into Rukmär, at a grand total of five expeditions, thereby making her the expert in all things Rukmär at present.

## Discovery of the Muno-Muni Tribes:

Hector Fries (fr-EES), first encountered the tribes of the Muno-Muni on an expedition to chart the jungles and swamps of the Serpent's Veil, a canyon that opens to the sea and winds it's way further inland and treacherously upward. The 'veil' lies in the south western most region of the Aedervens. Muno-Muni are named after Fries's navigator duo. Fries, and co., found these natives observing their encampment, and after some brief tensions, found the natives to be accommodating. The Muno-Muni appeared unlike any other people they had come across, they were reptilian in appearance, but anthropomorphic, in other words they looked very humanoid. However, the Muno-Munis' intentions were not altruistic in nature. And while the explorers were able to document much of the encounter and the appearance of culture, they were ultimately led to a cooking fire, and eaten one by one.

We know this due to remnants of records that were left and found by recovery expeditions to the region. Their remains were recovered, through much conflict, as well as their records of the first contact, though a little chewed and tattered. It has now been established that expeditions to the area are to go with a full escort. And Hector became a cautionary tale summed up in the phrase, "Hector fries overeager."

## Emerant: The Enigma:

Utilizing advanced magical protection and a meticulously planned expedition, the Explorer's League attempted to solve the mystery of the abandoned city of Emerant. Although the fate of the explorers remains unknown, their courageous attempt sparked widespread interest and speculation about the ancient city's secrets. So far no expedition, League or otherwise, no matter how prepared, has returned from Emerant.

The most famous example of this was when Khazimir Al'Ferak, the former Merchant Prince of the Jirian Research and Development complex, decided that he would go himself, with military might, a total of three airships, one carrack and two galleons, to see why so many failed to return. There was a lot of information gathering and planning before Al'Ferak's voyage across to Emerant, and several days were simply spent picking a landing spot once they had arrived. It is, after all, thanks to the Jirians and their airships that we have any maps at all of Emerant. Another Khazimir, Haroun Al'Qadir, sent along a smaller vessel just to keep an eye on the expedition, eager to know if Al'Ferak would succeed. The account of Al'Ferak's descent into the city and subsequent landing in a plaza just south of center indicate no issues. They could see the ships, and even managed to witness the crews disembarking from the ships. However, in a brief moment, the blink of an eye, the ships, the crews, the Khazimir were all gone.

Different crew members report losing sight of the crew at different times, which has led some to believe that as long as someone outside the city can see you, you can return. To the knowledge of the public record, however, no one has tested this theory.

## The Accords of the Da'Guur:

While on expedition to Rukmär, Captain Kenneth Hobart perished. It was his first venture into the wilds of Chaos. This is only significant insofar as that keepsakes and trophies, as well as the records of the expedition were returned to the base camp on the edge of the wilds by two unknown humanoids of possibly human decent. This was the first contact with Rukmär's enigmatic natives, who would later -- much later -- become known as the Da'Guur.

While the League desperately sought these native peoples, they -- even to this day -- can only be found if they want you to find them. And while many are willing guides, they will only guide so long as they choose, and often leave expedition teams when least expected. Either that or the expedition teams get horribly lost, by not keeping their precious guides close enough.

Language is still a barrier, but strides are being made. Their writing and tongue confuse even the most cutting edge of magical translation, leading to more traditional approaches. Some mages theorize that the tongue they speak and write is magically encoded. Giving rise a rash of research into the inherent power of language itself.

From what can be discerned, the Da'Guur view us with amusement, trying to tame the great Ontopedea, which -- as best we can extrapolate at the present this means "Divine Wilderness" -- and they seem to merely play the role of guide only so long as their curiosity is piqued. The Da'Guur have a closer relationship with Capt. Perrington than any other person known to the League; she says it's because they respect her, but this hasn't been corroborated by any Da'Guur as of yet. 

## The Shard of Elanismir:

Elanismir is an object of indeterminate purpose or origin, but, even shattered as it is, is immensely powerful. Currently only two shards have been recovered. The first was found in a field in Ione after a shower of stars. It had turned a rather temperate region, near fall harvest, into a frozen tundra on impact. A League expedition to a nearby barrow, was called to retrieve it and take the cursed thing away. The shard was like a shard of metal no bigger than a thumb, but it covered a land area of several square miles in frosty winter weather. The next shard, which seemed to have some kind of edge on it, was about as bit as a man's palm and was found in the den of a forgotten cult temple located in an ancient sunken complex in Fennsik on the western coast of the United Kingdoms of Lar. It appeared to be powering a blood ritual to resurrect a greater spawn of Xalrith, which -- thanks to the efforts of a League expeditionary team -- was thwarted, and the shard brought back.

Initially because each shard was found in completely different circumstances, they were categorized as separate relics, but after much research, fluctuation on whether they are or aren't, it has been decided that -- more than likely -- they are pieces of the same artifact. Taken out of the initial environments that they were found in, they seem inert. How the cultists of Xalrith managed to utilize the shard for a blood ritual, or a heavy impact trigger a localized ice age, still baffles the arcane societies to this day.
