### The Explorer's Code

1. Be Curious: Keep an open mind and look for the truth. Ignorance is the weapon of the enemy.

2. Be Bold: Don't just step, leap! Boldly go where no one has gone before!

3. Persevere: Exploration is a noble pursuit, filled with adversity! Whether it is a cliff or a mountain of red tape, keep going there is always an end â€“ and maybe keep some scissors for that pesky red tape.

4. Document your Findings: If there's nothing brought back, no record, not even a scribbled note of what occurred, it's just another tall tale! Document, document, document! Or find someone to do it for you, and don't lose them!

5. Foster Relationships: We are stronger together. The League would have never risen to the heights it has if not for a dedicated community of scholars, tradesmen, and the passionate adventurer! This community thrives so long as there is a community to find!

6. Don't be Careless: The artifacts you uncover, the beasts you find, the places you go are all living history! So much of the world has yet to be documented, mapped, explored. It's up to you on site to make sure that the relics retrieved are retrieved carefully, that the new people and societies discovered meet friends not foes, and that the places you go are not trampled so that no other can enjoy them!

Most Explorers view this Code as more a set of guidelines, especially the sixth code. If the goal is glory on Alar, then Explorers are supposed to be bold, then there's very little room for caution!
