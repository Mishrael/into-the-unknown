There are no organized groups that could be considered adversaries to the League. The most antagonistic being the Lorekeepers, or perhaps the Jirians, depending on if they want to claim what's being explored. Aside from that, the only groups that are adversarial are those that are generally adversarial to everyone, such as demon cults, and necromancers, and Imperialist Orcs.

The League's greatest challenge is the unknown! And how to get to the unknownâ€¦
