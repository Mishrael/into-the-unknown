The primary function of the Explorer's League is exploration – to broaden the horizons that were darkened by the demonic forces. The preservation of knowledge, while the primary goal on paper – so to speak – is secondary to the thrill, excitement, and glory won by achieving leaps and bounds in discovery.

The Explorer's League has become an organization known for definitely going out into the unknown, but not necessarily known for their wisdom in doing so. They've been characterized as the group that leaps first, thinks later, and the League has generally owned and leaned into that philosophy. But it's far from the truth in most situations. Going into the unknown is risky business, and it is difficult to predict what might happen at given point during an excursion.

## The Mission

#### Exploration.
To uncover what was darkened in hopes of a brighter future.

#### Community. 
To find a home no matter the place.

#### Glory.
To elevate a life into a legacy.
